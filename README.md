# UAV
tutorial 1

This contains the code that was used for the tutorial 1 of the UAV modelling and control. the purpose of these pieces of codes are to obtain the optimal specification of
propellors and motors based only on the weight of the proposed UAV. this does not take into account any change in weight for different motors but this should still give a
fairly good estimation of the motors and propellors that should be used. 
the code relies on emperical formulae for the energy required by motors and the thrust offered by a propeller based on its diameter and pitch.
